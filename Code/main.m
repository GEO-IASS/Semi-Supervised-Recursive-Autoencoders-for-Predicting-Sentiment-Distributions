% Clear all variables and start training afresh

% Make sure you add ./tools folder to your path because it contains important functions used in the code
% Using genpath to include all subfolders

% Setting parameters for training

% Empty parameter structure

% Dimensionality of the word size, change according to the word size required

% Regularization parameters, adapted from the paper
% Regularization for W(1), W(2), W(Label), L
parameters.regularization = [1e-05, 1e-04, 1e07, 1e-02];

% Weightage for errors

% Display mode

% Optimization method, can try different methods for minfunc as well
